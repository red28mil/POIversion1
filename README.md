I have created a Beaches of ireland app, using node.js, HTML, Handlebars, Hapi(inert, vision, cookie, axios, joi, boom,) Mongodb, Mongoose,chai@mocha. I started using vs code but ran into some trouble when i was changing my html pages to Handlesbars so i started my project again in webstorm instead.I have found dthis easier to use for this project but i had some issues with my mongodb install and use of mongoose which took quite some time to resolve.I could add api and get data but my fetch data would only work on html page even tough i spent alot of time studying fetching data in node. I have implemented login logout,map data aboout beaches and added weather data retrieval and alos left in a donate option so users could donate to clean up beaches.I have commited everything to git with branches and all changes added.
